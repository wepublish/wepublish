### How to call an api endpoint from the UI (.tsx file)?
Prerequisite: In the API (packages/api) exists a corresponding GraphQL endpoint.

1) In `editor/src/client/api` you have to create a corresponding graphql file or define your mutation or query in an existing one.
2) Start the API (`yarn watch`)
3) Navigate in your terminal to `packages/editor` and run `yarn generate:api`
4) Now the file `index.ts` will be generated automatically `in editor/src/client/api`
5) Now you can import your desired endpoint in your .tsx file. See for example `subscriptionEditPanel.tsx`

## packages/api
### Subscriptions
#### Receiving webhooks from payment providers such as Stripe or Payrexx
The webhook will call `paymentProvider.updatePaymentWithIntentState()` which will create a payment.
This creates a payment creation event which is caught by `paymentProvider.setupPaymentProvider()`.
Within this event another invoice event will be triggered which is handled in `events.invoiceModelEvents()`

## packages/mongo-db
### Migrations
To perform migrations on the database two steps are necessary.
1. add an object in migrations.ts.
2. restart the API (yarn watch)
